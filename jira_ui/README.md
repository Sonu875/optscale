# OptScale Jira integration UI

### Running and Debugging

A full «How make initial setup» guide is available [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/getting-started-with-connect/)

1. [Get a cloud development site](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/getting-started-with-connect/#step-1--get-a-cloud-development-site)

2. [Set up your local development environment](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/getting-started-with-connect/#step-3--set-up-your-local-development-environment)

To launch application in the development mode step through guide below:

> Ensure, that the `Jira` service is selected in the main menu — installation won't work for any other atlassian service

1. `cd ui`

2. Create`.env` file and define environment variables. Samples could be found here - `ui/.env.sample`

3. Run development server (`cd ui && npm start`). By default the application will start on 3001 port

4. Make the app available to the internet (`ngrok http 3001`)

5. Install and test your app (see [Step 3: Install and test your app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/getting-started-with-connect/#step-3--install-and-test-your-app)).

   `atlassian-connect.json` could be generated by `jira_bus/v2/app_descriptor` api using `base_host` parameter. Base host is your public ngrok url without protocol (`https://` will be added automatically).

   Examples:

   - `https://<YOUR_OPTSCALE_HOST>/jira_bus/v2/app_descriptor?base_host=<YOUR_NGROK_HOST>`
   - `https://dev-2.optscale.com/jira_bus/v2/app_descriptor?base_host=bb5a163ef415.ngrok.io`
